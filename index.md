# Let the Wauwatosa School Board know you support Open Enrollment

There is potentially a pending vote by the Wauwatosa School board on Open Enrollment.  *It is being said that the community does not support Open Enrollment in Tosa schools*, if you do support it however, the board and Dr. Means needs to hear it.

Please use this link to **send a public comment email to Dr. Means and the Tosa School board to show your support**.  

Also, feel free to add any personalizing details!  The point of this is to make it easy for people to find the appropriate emails and have a simple template to start from.
