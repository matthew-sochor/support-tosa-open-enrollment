# Let the Wauwatosa School Board know you support Open Enrollment

There will potentially be a vote by the Wauwatosa School board on Open Enrollment.  

It is being said that the community does not support Open Enrollment in Tosa schools.  **If you disagree and do support Open Enrollment, the board and Dr. Means needs to hear it.**
